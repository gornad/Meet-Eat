# Meet & Eat

##Inspiration

We observed that many events around campus don't achieve their target attendance just because students are busy or don't find the value in going.

##What it does

This app benefits the student, the event organizer and the sponsor by encouraging students to go to these events. The app rewards the student with points by staying in events and these points can be used to get food in participating stores. The app also shows events that have free food..

##How we built it

We built the backend with Javascript and Jade. We set up the database using mongodb. The frontend was accomplished with xamarin to achieve cross platform functionality.

##Challenges we ran into

Connecting the frontend to the backend non locally.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of

Coming up with a wonderful idea and executing it.

##What we learned

Xamarin and mongodb.

##What's next for Meet & Eat

Establish a reliable connection between the frontend and backend and materialize a business plan.
